    <h4>
      I have three reasons why Naruto is my favorite. First of all, his anime on him is amazing, best thing that i have ever watched. Second is that he always makes friends with the enemies, like i dont know why but he dose it and it is very heart warming. Finally that iconic smile. But i got only one proble with the leaf vilage okay so the two stongest ninja ARE THE LOWSET RANK LIKE GET YOUR FACTS STRIGHT LEAF VILAGE LIKE COME ON MANNN.

      <h4>
        My second favorite is Sasuke Uchiha. He is just a god in all types of ways, oh and remember when I said 2 of the strongest ninja well he is tied in first with naruto they both fought and lost an arm i know very painful. Well... it looked more painful then it was.
